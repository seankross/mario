The topic of our session focuses on using technology to\n# implement data science and programming education and we were wondering if\n# you'd be interested in joining our session to speak about pythontutor.com.\n#\n# Your talk would last 20-30 minutes and it would be one of four talks. I will\n# be presenting my work with swirl and Nick Carchedi will be discussing his\n# work at a startup. Jeff will be chairing the session.\n#\n# Please let me know what questions you have and I look forward to hearing from\n# you.\n#\n# Thanks,\n# Sean Kross\n",
