# Hi Prof. Guo,

# I work in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab with Jeff Leek and we're putting
# together a group of speakers for an invited session at the 2017 Joint
# Statistical Meeting. The topic of our session focuses on using technology to
# implement data science and programming education and we were wondering if
# you'd be interested in joining our session to speak about pythontutor.com.
#
# Your talk would last 20-30 minutes and it would be one of four talks. I will
# be presenting my work with swirl and Nick Carchedi will be discussing his
# work at a startup. Jeff will be chairing the session.
#
# Please let me know what questions you have and I look forward to hearing from
# you.
#
# Thanks,
# Sean Kross
